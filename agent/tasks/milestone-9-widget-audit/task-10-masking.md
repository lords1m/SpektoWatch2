# Task 10-masking: Sound Masking

Status: pending
Created: 2026-05-21
Milestone: `milestone-9-widget-audit`

## Subject

- Widget type: `AudioWidgetType.masking` (verify exact case in
  `SpektoWatch2/WidgetConfiguration.swift`).
- Source: `SpektoWatch2/Masking/`
- Settings exposed: threshold, trigger logic, source selection

## Method

1. Read the widget source + its settings sheet. Note every public
   knob and every persisted setting key.
2. Launch on hardware (AGENT.md: local simulator is broken).
3. For every size in `WidgetConfiguration.sizeRange(for: .masking)`
   from min to max, capture a screenshot. Edit mode and view mode.
4. Cycle every settings combination. Capture before/after.
5. Stress: silence, clipped input, sample-rate change mid-stream,
   recording active vs inactive, dark mode, light mode.

## Specific checks

- trigger fires at the expected threshold against a known signal; abort path; UI feedback during armed state; persistence of thresholds.
- Layout integrity at each allowed size.
- Touch-target accessibility (>= 44pt).
- Color contrast pass for the displayed metric text.
- No `Logger` errors / warnings on the relevant subsystem during
  the audit.
- Settings persist across app restart.

## Output

- `agent/screenshots/m9-masking-<n>.png` (or linked from a shared
  album — note the source location here).
- Per-screenshot one-line annotation in this task file under
  "Findings".
- Findings split into: ✅ confirmed working, ⚠ open issue (file
  follow-up + link), ❌ broken (block acceptance).

## Acceptance

- All size + settings combinations covered with at least one
  screenshot.
- Findings list is exhaustive — every ⚠ / ❌ either has a fix in
  this task or a queued follow-up backlog item.

## Non-Goals

- Refactoring the widget's internal architecture beyond fixing
  obvious bugs surfaced by the audit.
- Cross-widget consistency (handled by the acceptance task).
